**Key Concepts**: DataFrame, Transformations (Lazy), Actions (Eager)

### Part 2: The Data Engineer's Toolkit (35 Minutes)
**Objective**: Master the true 80/20 of data engineering: shaping, joining, and aggregating data.

- **Module 2.1**: Aggregating (10 mins) - Group by order status and calculate order statistics
- **Module 2.2**: Joining (15 mins) - Combine customer data with orders (left vs inner join)
- **Module 2.3**: Cleaning & Saving (10 mins) - Handle nulls and save to Delta Lake

### Part 3: The ML Capstone Pipeline (40 Minutes)
**Objective**: Build, train, and track a complete, production-style ML pipeline using MLlib and MLflow.

- **Module 3.1**: Feature Engineering Pipeline (15 mins) - Extract time features, StringIndexer, VectorAssembler
- **Module 3.2**: Model Training & MLflow (15 mins) - Train RandomForest to predict order value and track with MLflow
- **Module 3.3**: Save & Load (10 mins) - Load model from MLflow and apply to new data

### Part 4: Real-Time Prediction (15 Minutes)
**Objective**: Use our saved batch model to score a live simulated stream.

- **Module 4.1**: The "Live Order" Simulator (10 mins) - Create streaming data with realistic rate (1 order/second)
- **Module 4.2**: Apply Model & Display Live (5 mins) - See live order value predictions updating in real-time

### Part 5: Wrap-Up & Next Steps (10 Minutes)
- Recap what we built
